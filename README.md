# Oragon

**Version 0.1a**

Oragon is a Discord Bot optimized for content creators.


## How to use it

Well. Once we get there, this part certainly will contain something. Currently it's just ```&roomlottery```.


## Installation

### The easy way

**You don't need to install it!** Simply use a link that doesn't exist yet but will be here once it does, and you're set to go!

### Hosting it manually

#### Before planning to host this bot, make sure to read the License section.

**If you want to host this on your own server**,
you need the following files in the root directory:

- **oragon.jar** (Well, duh)
- **login.oragon** (Contains the Discord Bot User Token)
- **apikey-yt.oragon** (Contains a YouTube Data API key)

Simply treat **.oragon** files like normal **.txt** files.

The files will automatically be removed on the first startup and you'll see one **config.oragon**
instead. If you need to override any value, simply recreate the affected file with its new value.

Run the server with ```java -jar oragon.jar```.

## License
All rights reserved.
You are allowed to host the bot on your own server, however, if it will only be active on Discord
Servers that you are the owner of.
